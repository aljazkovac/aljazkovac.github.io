I am the **Team Leader** for Platform Engineering and the **AI Initiative Lead** at [Caspeco](https://caspeco.com/), where I bridge the gap between technical infrastructure and organizational strategy.

With a background in journalism and education, I focus on building high-performing teams, robust systems, and practical AI strategies that drive real business value.

## The Professional Narrative

My career path has been defined by a transition from communication to technology. 

I started in journalism and education—fields that prioritize clarity, empathy, and the ability to synthesize complex information. These skills are now the foundation of my leadership style. In the tech world, I have found that the most challenging engineering problems are often human ones. My goal is to ensure that our technical architecture always serves our strategic objectives.
