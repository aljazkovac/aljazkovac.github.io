## <i class="fas fa-book-open text-muted me-2"></i> The Narrative

My career began in journalism and education. For several years, I was a voice on Slovenia's national radio, hosting [**Menuet za besedo**](https://ars.rtvslo.si/podkast/menuet-za-besedo/57660840), a show exploring the connections between music and literature. I also served as the editor-in-chief of a prominent Slovenian digital magazine, [**Airbeletrina**](https://airbeletrina.si/), where I oversaw a redesign of the website and led our content and communication strategy.

Later, I moved abroad, living in Germany, England, and Sweden. During this time, I remained active in journalism while transitioning into education. I taught English and German and served as a researcher at the Department of Education at Stockholm University.

This background in communication and education became my superpower when I transitioned into tech. I realized that the hardest engineering problems are often human ones: alignment, clarity, and culture. Today, I combine these communication strengths with a strong technical foundation in cloud-native systems to build high-performing teams and scalable architecture.
