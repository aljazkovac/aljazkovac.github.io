## Create a High-Performing Team

### Module 1: Get Started with People Management

The key ingredient to making your team more performant is the team manager. The best managers have more engaged, better performing teams and less turnover.

Google Manager Responsibilities is the core framework used by managers at Google, based on years of research and data. Its guiding principles are:

- Build community
- Deliver results
- Develop people

The goals of the course:

- Shift from being an individual contributor to a builder of high-performing teams
- Tools and strategies to deliver powerful results
- Ways to effectively coach and give feedback
- Develop own skills to become a more resilient and impactful leader

### Become an effective and impactful people manager

People management when done right touches people in incredible ways. People management is a privilege and should not be taken for granted.

Manager mindset: it shapes everything you do as a manager. Three key mindset shifts:

- **Shift focus from my work to the team's results**: don't try and do too much; delegate, and set team members up for success;
- **Shift from thinking about your own career to helping others progress in theirs**: help team members grow, stay motivated and progress in their careers. Get to know your team and understand where they want to go;
- **Shift from making project-level decisions, to considering the impact on the entire team**: your decisions affect other people. Consider the full impact of your decisions (or lack thereof -> not making a decision can be as damaging as making the wrong decision); what decisions do I need to make to help the team? Who else should I ask for information? What consequences will this decision have on team members and our performance?

**Key takeaway:**
It takes effort to shift your thinking into a manager mindset, but doing so will empower your team and drive meaningful outcomes.

To start, ask yourself:

- What tasks am I holding on to that could create opportunities for other team members?
- Whose potential have I not fully unlocked, and what can I do to support their career goals?
- In my next decision, how can I better weigh the potential impact on the team?

### Create an effective team

How a team works together is more important than who is on the team. Collaboration and a culture of learning are the key ingredients. Trust and open communication also.

Ways to build an effective team:

- Develop one-on-one relationships
- Promote open communication
- Create a culture of learning, not blame

Change your conversations:

- Shift the focus of your one-on-ones from simple status updates to genuine dialogues.
- Don't settle for silence in team meetings by inviting everyone's opinions.
- Reframe project failures from a search for blame to a quest for learning

There were some scenarios we had to work through. The last scenario we had to come up with ourselves. I decided to work on this:

| Aspect        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario**  | **A “difficult” team member**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Goal**      | Improve the culture and relationship with a coworker who is technically very capable but can be very difficult and unpleasant to work with.                                                                                                                        |
| **Approach**  | [**Radical Candor**](https://www.radicalcandor.com/frequently-asked-questions) (Kim Scott): Challenging directly while caring personally. I once addressed a colleague's behavior decisively, being honest about the impact while reaffirming my respect for them. |
| **Rationale** | This approach aligns with my preference for direct communication and transparency. I value directness, even when it involves difficult feedback.                                                                                                                   |

### Manage beyond the team

### Manage up and across your organization

Build relationships all around you! Proactively build relationships with your team, your peers and your managers and leaders.

1. Create a relationship map
2. Ask yourself the following questions:
   - Collaboration: Who leads the teams we currently work with or should be working with?
   - Inspiration: Who is leading work that I admire or want to learn more about?
   - Mentorship: Who has the experience or skills I could learn from?
   - Influence: Who makes the key decisions that impact my team's success?
3. Reach out and meet everyone on the list and build relationships. Find ways to be helpful!
4. Stay connected and be consistent

"Answering these questions transforms a vague goal ("I should network more") into a clear, actionable plan. You now know who to reach out to and, just as importantly, why."

Here are some possible ways to reach out:

- Offer specific help
- Share relevant information
- Show curiosity
- Provide a new perspective

To then build on that and put your network to that, here are some ideas:

- Identify shared goals
- Suggest combined efforts
- Propose joint solutions
- Address issues early

### Course certificate

This wraps up this course. The jist of it is to maintain relationships across the organization, and to nurture them over time. Then you can use those relationships to create a culture of collaboration and learning, not blame. It is crucial to adapt a manager's mindset: the focus is on the team, not yourself.

## Set and Achieve Team Goals

The main learnings of this course:

- Clear and compelling team roadmapping
- Effective work allocation
- How to combine high performance with genuine care and support goals for the team
- How to transform your approach to management

### Develop goals for the team

It is important that an individual on a team can see the connection of their work to the broader organizational goals. Achieve this through ongoing and constant communication. Set goals and define what success looks like. Be the wind in people's back. You will not be able to hit all your goals: When you don't win, you learn.

Key ingredients to help teams drive results:

- Clarity == everyone on the team can confidently explain what their role is and what the expectations on them are (requires consistent effort and two-way conversation)
- Meaning == your personal sense why you do this work. As a manager, you need to understand what motivates each team member.
- Impact == seeing the results of your work is proof that your work has an impact and motivates you.

How to set clear team goals:

- Get clarity on the organization's priorities and challenges
- Connect with the team on how to move the organization forward
- Break down team goals into clear individual goals

[SMART GOALS](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals): An approach that helps translate vision into reality when it comes to great goal-building.

- S: Specific
- M: Measurable
- A: Attainable
- R: Relevant
- T: Time-bound

Important: Periodically reevaluate if the goal still makes sense and can be achieved.

With these goals you are setting your team up for success because they know WHAT they are aiming for and WHY it matters.

Activity: Practice goal setting. Consider including something from the finished template: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fh5CDsOb8l8cnkkUR95jCDGXlXfMCs8X-pBZx3tT8fI/edit?tab=t.0>

Never set goals in a vacuum! Discuss them with your management and your team and collaborate to come up with a final version that everyone can collaborate on and feel proud to be doing.

### Allocate work effectively

Thoughtfully connect the right person to the right goal when allocating work.
Consider:

- Their skills
- Their interests
- Their current workload

Ask yourself: where can I give someone a chance to grow and shine?

When you talk to your team, go beyond status reports. Ask questions such as:

- What part of this goal are you most excited about?
- Where do you see the biggest opportunity?
- What will be most challenging for you?
- What new methods might you explore to reach the goal?

Both sides of equation: people and the needs of the business. A three-legged stool: the current state of the individual; the interest or goals of the individual; the need of the business.

The key to assigning work well is to look for opportunities in every task. Every project is a chance to build skills, engagement, and impact for team members. Great managers don't assign work, they design opportunities! It is important to balance "stretching" an employee with "utilizing their existing strengths" to ensure the project doesn't fail.

### Support the team in achieving goals

1. Know what everyone is working on and how they're doing: shared document, regular meetings, good project tracking.
2. Support team member by asking: How can I help you be successful? How is your work going? What's in your way? **Listen actively and be understanding!** => Feeling heard can make a huge difference!
3. Provide tangible support: training, connection with colleagues, help explore different points of view. Connect the team to the right resources and people.
4. Supporting the team is an active, ongoing process.

**How to lead an effective check-in:**

- Prepare for the check-in: Create a dedicated, shared document for each team member to capture their goals, check-in notes, and career interests.
- Start with a friendly connection
- Create the agenda together
- Use active listening
- Discuss performance
- Encourage decision-making
- Establish career checkpoints
- Provide clear takeaways and ensure alignment

## Support Individual Growth and Development

Focus on:

- What it means to be a good coach
- How to give effective feedback
- How to conduct meaningful performance reviews
- How to navigate tough conversation
- How to ask for and receive feedback

### Develop and coach the team

**The relationship between a manager and a report is very similar to the relationship between a coach and an athlete.**

The approach to developing a report:

- Identify the skill gap for the next level
- Work collaboratively to create a plan to close that gap
- Give coaching and feedback until they achieve that next level

Two of the most important factors in growth and development:

- Feedback: information you can provide to a report that is actionable by them and that helps them perform better
- Coaching: the act of collaborating with your report to give them guidance and help them grow

**Management is a learnable skill.**

The single most important thing good managers do is give good coaching and feedback.

Ask your team: What kind of coaching or feedback would you like from me?

Instead of providing answers, challenge team members to think through a challenge and come up with their own solutions. Ask open-ended questions, avoid leading questions. "Tell me more" works really well. Also, give the team member your full attention: put the phone down and close your laptop. Get comfortable with silence as well. Wait a few seconds before speaking. Also, repeat back information to confirm that you understand correctly (reflecting back or looping).

Reflecting back:

- This is what I'm hearing
- Do I have this right?
- What do you think would be the best next step?

Encourage questions and ask open-ended questions, instead of giving advice or helping out with a solution immediately. Give the person you're talking to your full attention. Be grounded, and be fully present.

### Provide feedback to team members

Feedback is one of the most important things a manager can give a team to support growth and development.

Qualities of effective feedback:

- Actionable
- Timely
- Specific

To share feedback in a structured way, use the [Situation - Behaviour - Impact (SBI) Model](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/closing-the-gap-between-intent-vs-impact-sbii/):

- You capture the situation
- Describe the behaviours that occured
- Describe the impact that the behaviours had

After sharing your feedback, pause and listen. Give the team member to share their thoughts and feelings. This builds trust.

**Feedback is not just for negative behaviours. Reinforce good behaviours by giving positive feedback, or sharing positive recognition with other managers and leaders.**

**How to give feedback with a coaching approach**:

1. **Start with a reflection**: Give the team member time to process the feedback. Encourage them to reflect and ask clarifying questions about the specific behaviors and their impact. You could ask, "What are your initial thoughts on the feedback I've shared?" or, "Is there anything I can clarify?"
2. **Identify areas for action**: Work together to pinpoint the specific areas for improvement. Ask open-ended questions like, "What steps could you take to enhance this skill?" or "What adjustments could we explore for this project?"
3. **Co-create a plan**: Encourage the team member to develop an action plan with specific steps and deadlines. Support their ownership by asking, "What do you think is the best way to move forward from here?"
4. **Offer support**: Guide the team member towards available resources - like mentors, colleagues, or training material - and facilitate connections if needed.
5. **Follow up**: Regularly check-in on progress, offer support, and celebrate successes along the way.

When you ask open-ended questions, avoid starting with "Why ...". This can make the report defensive.

**Navigating disagreement**:

- **Listen with empathy**: Acknowledge and validate their feelings without becoming defensive. Use phrases like, "I understand why you might feel that way," or "It's completely valid to feel..."
- **Reiterate your intent**: Remind them that the feedback is meant to support them. You could say, "I’m sharing this because I believe in your potential and want to help you succeed."
- **Focus on facts and impact**: Use specific, evidence-based examples, and explain the impact of the behavior, following the SBI™ Model.
- **Collaborate on a solution**: Make them a partner in finding the solution. Ask, "What solutions have you considered?" or "What ideas do you have for moving forward?"

### Measure and evaluate team member performance

Performance reviews create a structured opportunity to pause and reflect. It does not replace 1:1s, coaching and feedback. Use ongoing conversations to give ongoing feedback. Do not raise new issues from months ago in a performance review.

Performance review:

- Reflect on the year
- Ask questions: How do you feel you've grown since last year? What are you most proud of?
- Discuss growth opportunities
- Consider the future: set goals to take action on feedback, find ways to expand responsibilities, etc.

Provide a copy of the performance review in writing.

**Performance review template:**

**Step 1: Beginning of the cycle: Lay the foundation**
Successful reviews contain no surprises. They are the natural conclusion to a cycle that starts with clear expectations and is supported by your continuous coaching and feedback prior to the review.

- Set expectations and goals: Collaborate with each team member at the start of the cycle to set clear goals and define what success looks like in their role.
- Track progress on goals: Check in frequently to discuss progress toward goals and handle any challenges that arise.
- Give coaching and feedback along the way: Coaching and feedback are most effective when they are timely, so address issues and celebrate wins as they happen.

**Step 2: Before the review: Thoughtful preparation**
Your preparation is key to a productive review. Take time to get the full picture of your team member’s performance.

- Get perspectives beyond your own: Who has the team member been working with? Gather feedback from peers, other departments, or even clients to deliver a well-rounded review. Insight into how the team member works, collaborates with others, and achieves goals will help guide your feedback.
- Ensure feedback is relevant. Is the feedback you plan to deliver directly aligned with the team member’s job responsibilities and goals? If not, consider leaving it out.
- Challenge your own assumptions. Before delivering feedback, take a moment to check your perspective. Are you letting a recent project overshadow a year's work? Are you applying the same rating scale consistently to everyone?
- Explain the process: Be transparent with your team members about how the review process works. This will help them prepare to discuss their performance, challenges, and opportunities, so they can actively contribute to the conversation.

**Step 3: During the review: A two-way conversation**
The review meeting is more than just a look back; it's a launchpad for the future. Let’s look at how to transform a simple performance summary into a productive, two-way conversation that builds a collaborative plan for what's next.

- Encourage a two-way dialogue: Spark a conversation by asking open-ended questions like, "What achievement are you most proud of from this cycle?" Then, truly listen. Pausing allows the team member to respond to feedback and share their own insights, which might give you a new perspective to consider.
- Ground your feedback in facts: Use specific, evidence-based examples to support your assessments. This isn't just about identifying what needs to change; it's also about reinforcing what they should continue doing. This gives the team member a broader understanding of how to achieve high performance.
- Offer growth opportunities: Think of performance reviews as a chance to look forward. Talk with team members about how they'd like to grow. Help them find a mentor, take on a visible, high-impact project, or learn a new skill. To do this fairly, be sure you invest in the future of each team member. It's a great way to help them reach their full potential.
- Summarize and confirm next steps: Leave the meeting with clarity and alignment. Summarize the key takeaways and confirm the action plan you've built together. Simple questions like, “What support do you need from me to be successful?”, and "What questions do you have about our plan?" ensures you both leave the conversation on the same page, ready for the months ahead.

**Step 4: After the review: Continuing the momentum**
The review conversation doesn't end when the meeting is over. By revisiting the key topics after the meeting, you can transform a single conversation into a cycle of continuous growth.

- Finalize and share documentation: Promptly complete and share any official review paperwork, clearly outlining the goals and development plans you discussed. This provides the team member with a tangible guide for the coming months and reinforces the path you created together.
- Continue the conversation: Use your regular check-ins as an opportunity to follow up on goals, discuss progress, and offer continuous support. This helps turn the review’s insights into everyday action.
- Commit to their development: Show you are invested by following through on the plans you've created to help every team member grow. Your commitment to their growth is a powerful way to help them unlock their full potential.

**Difficult conversations build trust.** Here are some techniques to approach them with confidence:

Before:

- Clarify your goals
- Adopt an empathetic mindset

During:

- Approach the issue with empathy
- Ask open-ended questions
- Review the agenda
- Deliver the feedback (use the SBI model!)

Adapt the conversation to the person and their experience.

After:

- Share written next steps and a timeline

Being a people manager is a great opportunity to have more influence in the organization, enable others to perform to their best ability, and to pay it forward.

Upward feedback (getting feedback from the team on your leadership):

- Ask for feedback regularly
- Ask open-ended questions: How can I better support you? What would improve my communication with the team?
- Thank your team for their honesty

**The best leaders are always learning and your team's perspectives are priceless for your growth!**
