Two types of large language models (LLMs):

- base models (trained to predict the next word)
- instruction-tuned LLMs (trained to follow instructions): often trained with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)

## Prompting Principles

1. Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
   - Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
   - Ask for a structured output
   - Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied (check assumptions required to do the task)
   - "Few-shot" prompting (give successful examples)

2. Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
   - Specify the steps required to complete a task and ask for output in a specified format
   - Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

**Model Limitations: Hallucinations!**

## Iterative Prompt Development

Idea -> Implementation (code/data) -> Experimental result -> Error analysis -> Repeat

## Summarizing text

- Summarize with a focus on different aspects
- Try "extract" instead of "summarize"

## Inferring

- Identify sentiment (positive/negative)
- Identify types of emotions
- Extract various information from a text
- Inferring topics

## Text transformation

Various types of text transformation: language translation, spelling and grammar checking, tone adjustment, and format conversion.
