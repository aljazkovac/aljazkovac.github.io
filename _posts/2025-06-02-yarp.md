description: Comparing two coding approaches on the case of a custom YARP reverse proxy 
---

## The goal

While working with a custom reverse proxy at [Caspeco AB](https://caspeco.com/), I became interested in reverse proxies in general. I wanted to try building my own from scratch. Since I mostly work in .NET, I chose [YARP](https://github.com/dotnet/yarp), the go-to reverse proxy library for .NET.

But my goal was more ambitious: I wanted to write two custom reverse proxies! The first would use "vibe-coding" (LLM-assisted), and the second would be written the old-fashioned way—by hand.

I also wanted to learn the basics of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), two popular open-source monitoring tools. As a DevOps engineer, I love my dashboards. I work with Azure daily, so this was a good chance to broaden my horizons.

## Architecture

A reverse proxy needs backend services to forward requests to. I built one backend service, but ran two containers of it, giving me two services to proxy requests to. I also spun up Prometheus and Grafana containers. The `docker-compose.yml` file shows the project architecture:

```yaml
services:
  product-service-a:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: src/Services/ProductService/ProductService.Api/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5001:8080" # Host:Container. 8080 is the default HTTP port for .NET 8+ aspnet images
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8080 # Explicitly set container HTTP port
      
  product-service-b:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: src/Services/ProductService/ProductService.Api/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5011:8080" # Host:Container. 8080 is the default HTTP port for .NET 8+ aspnet images
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8080 # Explicitly set container HTTP port

  postgres-db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine # Using PostgreSQL version 15 on Alpine Linux for a smaller image
    container_name: yarp_postgres_db # Optional: give the container a specific name
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: yarpuser        # Define the default superuser for the database
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: yarpPassword  # Define the password for the superuser
      POSTGRES_DB: yarp_routing_db   # Optional: Creates this database automatically on first run
    ports:
      - "5432:5432" # Map host port 5432 to container port 5432 (default PostgreSQL port)
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Persist database data
    restart: unless-stopped # Optional: restarts the DB container if it stops, unless manually stopped

  gateway-api: 
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: src/ManualGateway/ManualGateway.Api/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5012:8080" # YARP gateway will be accessible on host port 5012
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8080 # Gateway container listens on 8080
    depends_on: # Good practice: ensure backend services start first
      - product-service-a
      - product-service-b
      - postgres-db
    
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    container_name: prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./monitoring/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml # Bind mounts the config file into the container
      - prometheus_data:/prometheus # Named volume to persist metrics data
    command:
      - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
      - '--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus'
      - '--web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries'
      - '--web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles'
    restart: unless-stopped
  
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana-enterprise
    container_name: grafana
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana
    environment:
      - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - prometheus
      
volumes:
  postgres_data: # This named volume will store the PostgreSQL data
  prometheus_data: # This named volume will store the Prometheus metrics data
  grafana_data: # This names volume will store the Grafana data
```

I included a postgres-db container so I could read service deployments from a database, enabling dynamic routing.

### Product service

This is a classic Domain-Driven Design (DDD) backend service, structured as follows:

Domain (business logic) → Infrastructure (data access) → Application (application logic) → API (exposes the application)

I won't go into detail about Domain-Driven Design here—there are better resources available. In short: you define the aggregate root and the contract for accessing and modifying it. Then, you implement methods for operating on the aggregate root. Next, you add layers for data transfer (DTOs) and methods that call repositories and transform data as needed. Finally, the API layer exposes these methods.

#### Method of implementation

I vibe-coded this part and didn't write most of the code myself, except for small changes and adjustments.

### YARP

I started by asking: Why is it called a "reverse" proxy? After some research, I learned:

There are traditional proxies (forward proxies) and reverse proxies. A forward proxy sits in front of a client and forwards its requests to the internet. A reverse proxy sits in front of a server and handles requests coming from clients.

The typical flow looks like this:

[Client] ⇄ [Forward Proxy] ⇄ [Internet] ⇄ [Reverse Proxy] ⇄ [Backend Server]

#### Method of implementation

##### Vibe coding

I vibe-coded the reverse proxy by querying an LLM, mostly [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/) in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). I was pleasantly surprised to get a working version, though it felt complicated. Since I vibe-coded the proxy first and only later implemented one by hand, I wasn't sure exactly why it felt awkward and bloated.

##### Classical coding

I then decided to implement a reverse proxy by writing it myself. I started by reading about [reverse proxies in general](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling), then the [YARP documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/yarp/yarp-overview?view=aspnetcore-9.0), and finally code samples from the [official YARP repo](https://github.com/dotnet/yarp/tree/main/samples).

Here's what I learned:

1. There are two ways to provide routing logic: configuration files and code.
2. You can route requests in many ways—by headers, queries, cookies, etc.
3. The most native way to achieve programmatic routing is to modify YARP's built-in pipeline with custom middleware.

The last point became clear when I looked at this code example from YARP's official repo:

```csharp
// Licensed to the .NET Foundation under one or more agreements.
// The .NET Foundation licenses this file to you under the MIT license.

using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Yarp.ReverseProxy.Configuration;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Yarp.ReverseProxy.Model;

const string DEBUG_HEADER = "Debug";
const string DEBUG_METADATA_KEY = "debug";
const string DEBUG_VALUE = "true";

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddReverseProxy()
    .LoadFromMemory(GetRoutes(), GetClusters());

var app = builder.Build();


app.Map("/update", context =>
{
    context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<InMemoryConfigProvider>().Update(GetRoutes(), GetClusters());
    return Task.CompletedTask;
});
// We can customize the proxy pipeline and add/remove/replace steps
app.MapReverseProxy(proxyPipeline =>
{
    // Use a custom proxy middleware, defined below
    proxyPipeline.Use(MyCustomProxyStep);
    // Don't forget to include these two middleware when you make a custom proxy pipeline (if you need them).
    proxyPipeline.UseSessionAffinity();
    proxyPipeline.UseLoadBalancing();
});

app.Run();

RouteConfig[] GetRoutes()
{
    return
    [
        new RouteConfig()
        {
            RouteId = "route" + Random.Shared.Next(), // Forces a new route id each time GetRoutes is called.
            ClusterId = "cluster1",
            Match = new RouteMatch
            {
                // Path or Hosts are required for each route. This catch-all pattern matches all request paths.
                Path = "{**catch-all}"
            }
        }
    ];
}

ClusterConfig[] GetClusters()
{
    var debugMetadata = new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        { DEBUG_METADATA_KEY, DEBUG_VALUE }
    };

    return
    [
        new ClusterConfig()
        {
            ClusterId = "cluster1",
            SessionAffinity = new SessionAffinityConfig { Enabled = true, Policy = "Cookie", AffinityKeyName = ".Yarp.ReverseProxy.Affinity" },
            Destinations = new Dictionary<string, DestinationConfig>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
            {
                { "destination1", new DestinationConfig() { Address = "https://example.com" } },
                { "debugdestination1", new DestinationConfig() {
                    Address = "https://bing.com",
                    Metadata = debugMetadata  }
                },
            }
        }
    ];
}

/// <summary>
/// Custom proxy step that filters destinations based on a header in the inbound request
/// Looks at each destination metadata, and filters in/out based on their debug flag and the inbound header
/// </summary>
Task MyCustomProxyStep(HttpContext context, Func<Task> next)
{
    // Can read data from the request via the context
    var useDebugDestinations = context.Request.Headers.TryGetValue(DEBUG_HEADER, out var headerValues) && headerValues.Count == 1 && headerValues[0] == DEBUG_VALUE;

    // The context also stores a ReverseProxyFeature which holds proxy specific data such as the cluster, route and destinations
    var availableDestinationsFeature = context.Features.Get<IReverseProxyFeature>();
    var filteredDestinations = new List<DestinationState>();

    // Filter destinations based on criteria
    foreach (var d in availableDestinationsFeature.AvailableDestinations)
    {
        //Todo: Replace with a lookup of metadata - but not currently exposed correctly here
        if (d.DestinationId.Contains("debug") == useDebugDestinations) { filteredDestinations.Add(d); }
    }
    availableDestinationsFeature.AvailableDestinations = filteredDestinations;

    // Important - required to move to the next step in the proxy pipeline
    return next();
}
```

So, for my custom implementation I tried to achieve something very similar:

```csharp
using ManualGateway.Api.Services;
using Prometheus;
using Yarp.ReverseProxy.Configuration;
using Yarp.ReverseProxy.Model;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Configuration.AddJsonFile("yarp.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true);
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddReverseProxy()
    .LoadFromConfig(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ReverseProxy"))
    .LoadFromMemory([], []);
builder.Services.AddScoped<SystemRoutingRepository>();

var app = builder.Build();

// At startup (before any HTTP requests), there's no active scope. Scoped services can only be resolved
// within an active scope context.
using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
{
    var repository = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<SystemRoutingRepository>();
    var initialRoutes = GetRoutesFromDatabase();
    var initialClusters = await GetClustersFromDatabase(repository);

    var configProvider = app.Services.GetRequiredService<InMemoryConfigProvider>();
    configProvider.Update(initialRoutes, initialClusters);
}

app.Map("/update", async context =>
{
    var repository = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<SystemRoutingRepository>();
    var routes = GetRoutesFromDatabase();
    var clusters = await GetClustersFromDatabase(repository);
    context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<InMemoryConfigProvider>().Update(routes, clusters);
});
// We can customize the proxy pipeline and add/remove/replace steps
app.MapReverseProxy(proxyPipeline =>
{
    // Use a custom proxy middleware, defined below
    proxyPipeline.Use(MyCustomProxyStep);
    // Don't forget to include these two middleware when you make a custom proxy pipeline (if you need them).
    proxyPipeline.UseSessionAffinity();
    proxyPipeline.UseLoadBalancing();
});

// Use and send metrics to Prometheus
app.UseHttpMetrics();
app.MapMetrics();

app.Run();

RouteConfig[] GetRoutesFromDatabase()
{
    return
    [
        new RouteConfig
        {
            RouteId = "product-route",
            ClusterId = "product-cluster",
            Match = new RouteMatch
            {
                Path = "/api/products/{**catch-all}"
            }
        }
    ];
}

async Task<ClusterConfig[]> GetClustersFromDatabase(SystemRoutingRepository repository)
{
    var systemRoutes = await repository.GetAllRoutesAsync();
    var destinations = new Dictionary<string, DestinationConfig>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

    foreach (var systemRoute in systemRoutes)
    {
        destinations.Add(
            $"product-dest-{systemRoute.SystemId}",
            new DestinationConfig { Address = systemRoute.ProductServiceTarget }
        );
    }

    return
    [
        new ClusterConfig()
        {
            ClusterId = $"product-cluster",
            Destinations = destinations
        }
    ];

}

/// <summary>
/// Custom proxy step that filters destinations based on a header in the inbound request
/// </summary>
Task MyCustomProxyStep(HttpContext context, Func<Task> next)
{
    // Can read data from the request via the context
    var destinationHeaderPresent = context.Request.Headers.TryGetValue("destination", out var headerValues) && headerValues.Count == 1;
    var destination = headerValues.FirstOrDefault();

    // The context also stores a ReverseProxyFeature which holds proxy specific data such as the cluster, route and destinations
    var availableDestinationsFeature = context.Features.Get<IReverseProxyFeature>();

    if (!destinationHeaderPresent || destination is null || availableDestinationsFeature is null)
    {
        context.Response.StatusCode = 400;
        context.Response.WriteAsync("Destination header not present. Cannot route the request.");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
    var filteredDestinations = availableDestinationsFeature.AvailableDestinations
        .Where(d => d.DestinationId.Contains(destination)).ToList();

    availableDestinationsFeature.AvailableDestinations = filteredDestinations;

    // Important - required to move to the next step in the proxy pipeline
    return next();
}
```

If one compares this to my vibe-coded implementation, the difference is obvious:

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;
using Gateway.Api.Services; // For SystemRoutingRepository
using Yarp.ReverseProxy.Forwarder; // For IHttpForwarder
using System.Net; // For DecompressionMethods, SocketsHttpHandler

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// 1. Load YARP static configuration (for inventory, orders, and fallback)
builder.Configuration.AddJsonFile("yarp.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true);

// 2. Add YARP services and load static config
builder.Services.AddReverseProxy()
    .LoadFromConfig(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ReverseProxy"));

// 3. Add our custom SystemRoutingRepository
builder.Services.AddScoped<SystemRoutingRepository>(); // Scoped is fine

// 4. Add IHttpForwarder for manual forwarding
builder.Services.AddHttpForwarder();

var app = builder.Build();

// 5. Prepare HttpClient for IHttpForwarder
// This configuration is recommended by YARP docs for direct forwarding.
var httpClient = new HttpMessageInvoker(new SocketsHttpHandler()
{
    UseProxy = false,
    AllowAutoRedirect = false,
    AutomaticDecompression = DecompressionMethods.None,
    UseCookies = false,
    ActivityHeadersPropagator = new ReverseProxyPropagator(DistributedContextPropagator.Current), // For distributed tracing
    ConnectTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15),
});
// Distributed Tracing Context: In a microservices architecture, a single user request might flow through multiple services
// (e.g., Gateway -> OrderService -> InventoryService). To trace the entire lifecycle of such a request across these services,
// a "trace context" (containing IDs like a Trace ID and Span ID) needs to be passed from one service to the next.
// W3C Trace Context / OpenTelemetry: The standard for propagating this context is often the W3C Trace Context specification,
// which defines specific HTTP headers (like traceparent and tracestate) to carry this information. OpenTelemetry is a widely
// adopted observability framework that implements these standards.
// ActivitySource and Activity: In .NET, distributed tracing is often implemented using System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource
// and System.Diagnostics.Activity. An Activity represents a unit of work and carries the trace context.
// DistributedContextPropagator: This is a .NET class responsible for injecting (serializing) the current Activity's context
// into outgoing HTTP request headers and extracting (deserializing) it from incoming HTTP request headers.
// DistributedContextPropagator.Current usually defaults to a propagator that handles W3C Trace Context headers.
// ReverseProxyPropagator: This is a YARP-specific wrapper. When YARP (acting as the IHttpForwarder) makes an outgoing request
// to a backend service, this propagator ensures that if there's an active Activity (trace context) on the incoming request
// to the gateway, its context is correctly propagated (i.e., the right headers like traceparent are added) to the outgoing request
// being sent to the backend service.
// Why SocketsHttpHandler needs it: The SocketsHttpHandler (which is the underlying handler for HttpClient / HttpMessageInvoker)
// doesn't automatically know about Activity propagation in the same way that the higher-level HttpClientFactory or ASP.NET Core's
// built-in client might. By setting the ActivityHeadersPropagator explicitly, we ensure that this httpClient instance used by
// IHttpForwarder participates correctly in distributed tracing.


// Get IHttpForwarder and ILogger for use in route handlers
var forwarder = app.Services.GetRequiredService<IHttpForwarder>();
var loggerFactory = app.Services.GetRequiredService<ILoggerFactory>();
var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger("DynamicProductRouting");

// 6. CUSTOM DYNAMIC ROUTING for ProductService
// This needs to be mapped *before* app.MapReverseProxy() if we want to intercept these paths.
app.Map("/products-api/{**rest}", async (HttpContext httpContext, string rest) =>
{
    // Try to get 'system' query parameter
    if (!httpContext.Request.Query.TryGetValue("system", out var systemIdValues) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(systemIdValues.FirstOrDefault()))
    {
        logger.LogInformation("Product route: 'system' query parameter missing or empty. Falling back to static YARP config.");
        // If 'system' query parameter is missing, we can either:
        // 1. Return a BadRequest
        // httpContext.Response.StatusCode = 400;
        // await httpContext.Response.WriteAsync("'system' query parameter is required for /products-api routes.");
        // return;

        // 2. Or, let it fall through to be handled by the static yarp.json config (if a route matches there)
        // To do this, we essentially re-invoke the YARP pipeline for this specific context.
        // This is a bit more advanced; for now, a simple fallback or error is easier.
        // For simplicity, let's assume if no 'system' is passed, we don't dynamically route here.
        // The request *might* be caught by app.MapReverseProxy() later if a general /products-api route exists there.
        // Let's explicitly say we require it for this dynamic path for now.
        httpContext.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest;
        await httpContext.Response.WriteAsync("The 'system' query parameter is required for this product API endpoint.");
        return;
    }

    var routingRepo = httpContext.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<SystemRoutingRepository>(); // Get repo from DI
    logger.LogInformation("Product route: Attempting dynamic route for systemId '{SystemId}' and path '/{Rest}'", systemId, rest);

    var systemRoute = await routingRepo.GetRouteBySystemIdAsync(systemId!);
    if (systemRoute == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(systemRoute.ProductServiceTarget))
    {

    logger.LogInformation("Product route: Forwarding to '{SystemRoute}/{Rest}' for systemId '{SystemId}'", productRoute, rest, systemId);

    // Forward the request. YARP takes care of copying headers, body, etc.
    // The 'rest' variable already includes the leading '/' if it was part of the original path after /products-api/
    // We need to ensure 'rest' correctly forms the path *after* the hostname.
    // If 'rest' starts with '/', destinationPrefix should not have a trailing '/'.
    // If 'rest' doesn't start with '/', destinationPrefix might need a trailing '/' or 'rest' needs a leading '/'.
    // The {**rest} captures segments including slashes.
    
    // Let's use the 'rest' parameter directly.
    // If original is /products-api/foo/bar then 'rest' is foo/bar
    // We need to send to http://target:8080/foo/bar
    // So, the path to forward is simply 'rest' if YARP expects the full path after hostname.
    // However, IHttpForwarder.SendAsync wants the full URI.

    // Let's rebuild the path for the backend:
    var backendPath = $"/{rest}{httpContext.Request.QueryString}";

    // This replaces the current request's path with the new one for forwarding
    // This is a simplified way; YARP's transforms offer more robust path manipulation.
    // For IHttpForwarder, we simply provide the full target URI.

    var targetUri = $"{productRoute}{backendPath}";
    logger.LogInformation("Product route: Constructed Target URI '{TargetUri}'", targetUri);

    var error = await forwarder.SendAsync(httpContext, targetUri, httpClient);

// 7. Map YARP reverse proxy middleware for all other routes (inventory, orders, or product fallback)

app.Run();
```

## Prometheus and Grafana metrics

I'd wanted to learn the basics of Prometheus and Grafana for a while. I have experience with Azure, but it's always good to know open-source alternatives. While deciding which metrics to set up, I learned about the __RED__ and __USE__ monitoring methodologies.

### RED Method (Request-focused)

_Best for:_ User-facing services, APIs, microservices

_Focuses on:_

- __Rate:__ How many requests per second
- __Errors:__ How many of those requests are failing  
- __Duration:__ How long those requests take

### USE Method (Resource-focused)

_Best for:_ Infrastructure, system resources

_Focuses on:_

- __Utilization:__ How busy a resource is (% time busy)
- __Saturation:__ How much extra work is queued (waiting)
- __Errors:__ Count of error events

I also asked an LLM ([Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet)) for recommendations on which metrics to set up. It provided a list of top 10 essential metrics. I tweaked them slightly to fit my services, but the original LLM recommendations were close.

### Top 10 Essential Metrics

#### RED Metrics (Service Performance)

1. __Request Rate__

   ```promql
   rate(http_requests_received_total[5m])
   ```

   _Measures how many HTTP requests per second your service is handling. Essential for understanding traffic volume and capacity planning._

2. __Error Rate (%)__

   ```promql
   rate(http_requests_received_total{code=~"5.."}[5m]) / rate(http_requests_received_total[5m]) * 100
   ```

   _Shows the percentage of requests returning 5xx server errors. High error rates indicate service problems or capacity issues._

3. __Response Duration (95th percentile)__

   ```promql
   histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
   ```

   _Shows how long 95% of requests take to complete. Reveals performance issues that averages might hide._

4. __Service Availability__

   ```promql
   up
   ```

   _Binary metric showing if Prometheus can reach your service (1=up, 0=down). Critical for detecting outages._

#### USE Metrics (Resource Monitoring)

5. __CPU Utilization__

   ```promql
   rate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m]) * 100
   ```

   _Shows CPU usage percentage over time. High CPU can indicate performance bottlenecks or insufficient resources._

6. __Memory Usage__

   ```promql
   process_working_set_bytes / 1024 / 1024
   ```

   `1024 / 1024` converts bytes to megabytes.
   _Displays memory consumption in MB. Helps detect memory leaks and plan resource allocation. Typical ranges for .NET apps: <100MB (excellent), 100-200MB (good), 200-500MB (acceptable), >500MB (investigate)._

7. __Garbage Collection Pressure__

   ```promql
   rate(dotnet_collection_count_total[5m])
   ```

   _Tracks .NET garbage collection frequency. High GC activity can impact performance and indicates memory pressure. Typical GC rates for .NET apps: <0.1/sec (excellent), 0.1-1.0/sec (good), 1.0-5.0/sec (concerning), >5.0/sec (critical). Gen 2 collections >0.1/sec need immediate investigation._

#### YARP-Specific Metrics

8. __Routing Distribution__

   ```promql
   sum by (job) (rate(http_requests_received_total[5m]))
   ```

   _Shows how traffic is distributed across backend destinations. Useful for load balancing verification and troubleshooting routing logic. `rate()` always returns per-second averages regardless of time window—multiply by 60 for per-minute or 3600 for per-hour._

9. __Proxy Latency__

   ```promql
   histogram_quantile(0.50, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job="gateway-api"}[5m]))
   ```

   _Measures total request duration through the gateway, including routing and backend response time. Shows proxy overhead plus backend latency. This represents user-experienced latency: gateway processing + network + backend processing + response time. Typical ranges for .NET APIs: <50ms (excellent), 50-200ms (good), 200-500ms (acceptable), >500ms (investigate)._

10. __Backend Health__

    ```promql
    up{job=~"product-service-.*"}
    ```

    _Monitors availability of backend services behind the proxy. Critical for detecting when specific backend instances fail._

### Quick Dashboard Layout

- __Traffic Panel:__ #1, #8 (Rate + Distribution)
- __Errors Panel:__ #2, #4 (Error rate + Availability) 
- __Latency Panel:__ #3, #9 (Response + Proxy duration)
- __Resources Panel:__ #5, #6, #7 (CPU, Memory, GC)

__Golden Rule:__ Start with RED for user experience, add USE for troubleshooting performance issues.

I set up these four panels in a Grafana dashboard and was happy with the result.

## Summary

In this project, I built two custom reverse proxies with YARP. The first was vibe-coded; the second I coded myself after reading the YARP documentation and official code examples. The difference was stark. Coding it myself produced a more performant, idiomatic YARP reverse proxy, and I understood the code in depth. I can’t say I truly understood the vibe-coded parts—at least not beyond a superficial level.

I did use LLMs extensively for research, which was helpful and deepened my understanding. My takeaway: vibe-coding is useful if you need something working quickly and don’t know where to start—it’s almost like a superpower: "Hey, I've built a reverse proxy in YARP, and I don't even know what a reverse proxy is!" But for anything long-term or production-ready, it’s better to learn the concepts, read the docs, and figure it out yourself. You’ll have to live with the code you write (or someone else will), and as an engineer, you want to build things that work well and are easy to maintain.

## Appendix: Cookies, Headers, and Query Parameters: Differences and Proxy Routing

When working with reverse proxies like YARP, it's important to understand the differences between cookies, headers, and query parameters, as each can be used for routing decisions:

| Feature         | Cookies                | Headers                | Query Parameters         |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Where           | `Cookie` header        | Any HTTP header        | URL (after `?`)         |
| Set by          | Server/Client          | Client/Server          | Client                  |
| Visibility      | Not in URL             | Not in URL             | In URL                  |
| Persistence     | Can persist            | Per-request            | Per-request             |
| Use cases       | Sessions, auth, prefs  | Auth, routing, meta    | Filters, routing, data  |
| Sent with       | All matching requests  | Only when set          | Only that request       |
| Path attribute  | Yes                    | No                     | No                      |

- **Cookies** are small pieces of data stored on the client and sent automatically with requests to matching domains/paths. They're often used for session management or user affinity, and can be used for routing in proxies via custom code.
- **Headers** are metadata sent with each HTTP request/response. They're flexible, not visible in the URL, and are commonly used for authentication, custom routing, or tenant selection in proxies.
- **Query parameters** are part of the URL and are visible in logs and browser address bars. They're easy to use for routing and filtering, but are only sent for the specific request.

**In YARP:**
- Header and query parameter-based routing is supported out of the box in static config.
- Cookie-based routing requires custom code in the YARP pipeline.

For API routing, headers and query parameters are most common, but cookies are useful for session or affinity scenarios.
