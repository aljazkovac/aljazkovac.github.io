## Create a High-Performing Team

### Module 1: Get Started with People Management

The key ingredient to making your team more performant is the team manager. The best managers have more engaged, better performing teams and less turnover.

Google Manager Responsibilities is the core framework used by managers at Google, based on years of research and data. Its guiding principles are:

- Build community
- Deliver results
- Develop people

The goals of the course:

- Shift from being an individual contributor to a builder of high-performing teams
- Tools and strategies to deliver powerful results
- Ways to effectively coach and give feedback
- Develop own skills to become a more resilient and impactful leader

### Become an effective and impactful people manager

People management when done right touches people in incredible ways. People management is a privilege and should not be taken for granted.

Manager mindset: it shapes everything you do as a manager. Three key mindset shifts:

- **Shift focus from my work to the team's results**: don't try and do too much; delegate, and set team members up for success;
- **Shift from thinking about your own career to helping others progress in theirs**: help team members grow, stay motivated and progress in their careers. Get to know your team and understand where they want to go;
- **Shift from making project-level decisions, to considering the impact on the entire team**: your decisions affect other people. Consider the full impact of your decisions (or lack thereof -> not making a decision can be as damaging as making the wrong decision); what decisions do I need to make to help the team? Who else should I ask for information? What consequences will this decision have on team members and our performance?

**Key takeaway:**
It takes effort to shift your thinking into a manager mindset, but doing so will empower your team and drive meaningful outcomes.

To start, ask yourself:

- What tasks am I holding on to that could create opportunities for other team members?
- Whose potential have I not fully unlocked, and what can I do to support their career goals?
- In my next decision, how can I better weigh the potential impact on the team?

### Create an effective team

How a team works together is more important than who is on the team. Collaboration and a culture of learning are the key ingredients. Trust and open communication also.

Ways to build an effective team:

- Develop one-on-one relationships
- Promote open communication
- Create a culture of learning, not blame

Change your conversations:

- Shift the focus of your one-on-ones from simple status updates to genuine dialogues.
- Don't settle for silence in team meetings by inviting everyone's opinions.
- Reframe project failures from a search for blame to a quest for learning

Interesting exercises and scenarios: consider adding some from Google Docs: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GtKoX3_mmxHDFwsJNRBIzd2ehb16Z71rzrCycFGYUFg/edit?tab=t.0>

There were some scenarios we had to work through:



### Manage beyond the team

### Manage up and across your organization

Build relationships all around you! Proactively build relationships with your team, your peers and your managers and leaders.

1. Create a relationship map
2. Ask yourself the following questions:
   - Collaboration: Who leads the teams we currently work with or should be working with?
   - Inspiration: Who is leading work that I admire or want to learn more about?
   - Mentorship: Who has the experience or skills I could learn from?
   - Influence: Who makes the key decisions that impact my team's success?
3. Reach out and meet everyone on the list and build relationships. Find ways to be helpful!
4. Stay connected and be consistent

"Answering these questions transforms a vague goal ("I should network more") into a clear, actionable plan. You now know who to reach out to and, just as importantly, why."

Here are some possible ways to reach out:

- Offer specific help
- Share relevant information
- Show curiosity
- Provide a new perspective

To then build on that and put your network to that, here are some ideas:

- Identify shared goals
- Suggest combined efforts
- Propose joint solutions
- Address issues early

### Course certificate

This wraps up this course. The jist of it is to maintain relationships across the organization, and to nurture them over time. Then you can use those relationships to create a culture of collaboration and learning, not blame. It is crucial to adapt a manager's mindset: the focus is on the team, not yourself.
