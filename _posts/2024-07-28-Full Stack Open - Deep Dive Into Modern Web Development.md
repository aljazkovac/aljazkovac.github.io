## Overview

[Full Stack Open - Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) is a great course that covers the full spectrum of modern full stack web development. It gives a good foundation in everything from the basics of React and Javascript to Redux, MongoDB, GraphQL, Typescript, Docker containers and relational databases. It even touches on modern mobile development with React Native and the basics of CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

I have finished every single exercise in the entire course, and I would recommend anyone aiming to get the most out of the course
to do the same. I must, however, say that this is a time-consuming project.
It takes constant dedication over several months at least, depending on how much free time you have. I worked full-time
as a software developer while taking this course, and combined with my family obligations, I could only dedicate a few hours
on the weekends. With that little free time it took me almost two years to finish it.

Please check out my [main repo for the course](https://github.com/aljazkovac/fullstackopen-part0-to-part9-react-graphql-ts).

Unfortunately, I don't have the time to condense my rather extensive notes on the course into a blog post.
I started this blog after I was already done with the course.
